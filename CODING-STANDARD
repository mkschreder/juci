In order to keep juci project in a consistent shape it is a good idea to follow
a few coding guidelines when committing your code. These are not to be
interpreted as some kind of dictator-do-this-or-die laws. These are here to
make sure nobody has to later dig through a pile of code where things look the
same but behave unpredictably. 

The purpose of a coding standard is to enable programmer to infer behaviour
from the looks of code. I use such standards all the time even in other
projects where for example in C all functions are prefixed with struct name
that they accept as their main object (self) and function such as foo_new()
infers a memory allocation and the necessity to use foo_delete(ptr) later. In
many cases things like this greatly simplify working with a codebase without
having to know it inside out. 

So what guidelines are there for JUCI then? 

Keep in mind that not even I myself always manage to follow all of these. But
it helps to look at them now and then and follow as many as possible. Some of
these guidelines have been added after a lot of code has already been written
and such code is changed whenever the opportunity arises. Changing old code is
always better done incrementally while making sure things continue to work
after making the change.. 

Controllers and widgets
-----------------------

- All widgets should be named after their module + what object they operate on
  + optional "edit" at the end if the widget is used for editing and object. 

	Example: 
	network-connection-proto-edit: makes it clear that this widget belongs to
	network module, is used to edit a network connection and focuses on field
	proto (along maybe with modifying other fields inside a connection, but
	mainly proto) and is used for editing. Such a widget should take a network
	connection object as it's ng-model. Using ng-model is also important
	because some components create widgets dynamically and assume ng-model as
	the parameter to be used to pass object "self" reference to the widget.
	Making a widget use something else would therefore break such usage
	scenarios. 

- All html and js should be separated into a js and html files. Writing inline
  html in the definition of a widget directive almost always means moving it
  out into it's own file later when it becomes necessary to extend it further.
  Why do the same work twice? 

- Html file and js file should have the same name (different extension) and
  should always be the same as the name of the widget. Furthermore also
  controller name and directive name should be the same.  

	Example: 
	Widget directive name: network-connection-proto-edit
	Html template: network-connection-proto-edit.html
	JS code: network-connection-proto-edit.js
	Directive definition: networkConnectionProtoEdit
	Controller: networkConnectionProtoEdit

- Pages follow the same rules as directives. Since pages are themselves
  directives, they largely work and behave the same as directives. With sole
  exception that controller is specified in html instead of being specified in
  directive definition and that you do not actually define directives for pages
  (it is handled automatically). 

Translations
------------

- All strings that you use should be either fully static (written out in code)
  or use string formatting functions to insert various variables into the
  string. 

	Example: 
	alert($tr(gettext("This is a static string that is also both tagged for
	translation and translated at runtime"))); 
	
	var string = String.format("This is a static string with {count} items!", {
	count: 12 }); 
	
	Note: juci implements String.format according to this specification so you
	can assume this is supported!

- Always tag all static strings to be included into translation files. This is
  done automatically for html tags tagged with "translate" directive (which are
  translated as well). In code you tag strings using the dummy gettext(..)
  function. It does nothing but return the same string, but enclosing strings
  into this function makes them easy to parse out when generating translation
  files. 

	Example: 
	var mystring = "Foo string" <- wrong
	var mystring = gettext("Foo string") <- right

- The actual translation should always be done as close to user as possible
  (preferably in the html and second best in the controller). 
	
	Example: 
	alert($tr(gettext("Foo string"))) <- tag and translate the string before
	showing it to the user. 

- Try not to use dynamic data and never attemt to pass variables to gettext()

	Example: 
	alert($tr(gettext(variable))) <- wrong (will not be parsed but still wrong!)
	alert($tr(variable_string)) <- correct. But make sure your original string
	has been included for translation by being tagged somewhere else. 

	Including completely dynamic data for translation is problematic so
	whenever possible avoid trying to translate messages sent from server. 

- Always translate strings that you write directly in html.

	Example: 
	<my-tag translate>This string will be localized!</my-tag>
	<my-tag title="{{'This string will also be localized!'|translate}}"/>
	<my-tag title="Some String"/> <- wrong! Will not localize correctly. 

Library and backend functions
-----------------------------

Note: Some of these can be questionable and some may not be consistently applied.  

- When adding new "private" fields to uci objects, always prefix them with an
  underscore to avoid name clashes with fields added by the owner of the
  object. Normally it makes sense to avoid adding extra fields completely but
  sometimes it can make sense and simplify code.  

	Example: 
	$uci.get_some_config().done(function(result){
		$scope.myinternalstuff = result.values.map(function(x){
			x._private_value = <some calculated value>
		}); 
	}); 
	
	You can probably use something like this as well: 
	$uci.get_some_config().done(function(result){
		$scope.myinternalstuff = result.values.map(function(x){
			return {
				value: x,
				private_value: <some calculated value>
			}; 
		}); 
	});

	This would avoid modifying original returned object. 

- All juci core object methods begin with $, while properties are named without the $.  
	
	Example: 
	$uci.config.$create()
	section.$delete()
	section.field.value

	This mainly makes sure that methods and fields can coexist without ever
	creating name clashes. Fields are for example dynamically created based on
	which fields have been defined for the object. We want to have fields named
	"create" for example, so we use prefix for all methods to avoid a clash.
